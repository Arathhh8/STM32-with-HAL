Hello world

In the last project (stm32f103xx_drivers) I've been developing my own drivers from scratch (without HAL), reading and reading from the datashet. So, now, I really understand the behind the scene of the microcontroller (RCC, GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART). 
For this project I will include HAL to make my way faster, developing little projects, testing, and debbuging the HAL code.
